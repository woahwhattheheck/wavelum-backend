# Lumina Backend

Node.js backend API and services for the Lumina Network â€” a blockchain-based vesting vault and token streaming platform on Stellar Soroban.

## Overview

Lumina Backend provides the off-chain infrastructure powering the Lumina ecosystem. It includes a REST API, GraphQL endpoint, WebSocket server, job queue workers, Soroban integration services, and database management â€” all containerized for scalable deployment.

## Features

- **REST API** â€” Express.js server for vesting schedule management, claims processing, and administrative operations
- **GraphQL API** â€” Apollo GraphQL endpoint for flexible data queries
- **WebSocket Server** â€” Real-time event streaming via Socket.IO and NestJS WebSockets
- **Soroban Integration** â€” Stellar Soroban SDK client for on-chain contract interactions
- **Background Workers** â€” Bull/BullMQ job queue workers for async processing (vesting, Soroban indexer, PII scrubbing)
- **Analytics** â€” Off-chain vesting analytics and historical data aggregation
- **Authentication** â€” JWT-based auth with Passport.js and NestJS guards
- **File Processing** â€” CSV and xlsx report generation, file upload handling via Multer
- **Notification System** â€” SendGrid email integration

## Pipeline performance

[![Last default-branch quality-gate duration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stellar-network-builders/wavelum-backend/ci-performance-badge/pipeline-duration.svg)](https://github.com/stellar-network-builders/wavelum-backend/actions/workflows/e2e-pipeline.yml)

This measures the interval from workflow creation (or rerun attempt start) through
collection of the four quality-stage results. Green/red gate finalization, artifact
upload and badge publishing follow this measurement and are excluded.
Lint, unit, contract and E2E jobs have 2, 5, 10 and 15 minute limits.
The parallel performance gate measures stages and total elapsed time, includes queue
time in the 30 minute total budget, reports violations and cancels unfinished work.
Every job has a bounded timeout; the watchdog has a 45 minute hard timeout.
The workflow does not support a workflow-level timeout setting, so the total watchdog
bounds its own execution only; it cannot enforce an absolute queue-inclusive
45 minute workflow deadline. The deployment green gate requires SLA success.

The badge above is generated from measured seconds of trusted main-branch pushes
on the dedicated ci-performance-badge branch. It appears after the first eligible run;
PR runs never publish it. Open a run's summary for measured minutes and download its `pipeline-performance`
artifact for the actual `pipeline-duration.svg` badge and JSON timing record.
PRs receive read-only Actions tokens on forks; cancellation may be denied there,
but job timeouts and the failed performance gate still block deployment.

Issue #43 remains partially open: a 30 minute limit on the complete workflow,
including finalization and arbitrary GitHub queue delays, is not guaranteed by this
quality-gate measurement or by the watchdog's 45 minute job timeout.
